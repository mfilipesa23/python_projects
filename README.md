### Disclaimer

This folder contains a list of simulated smaller real-life projects using Python programming language.

The projects are developped within the context of academic learning from "Codecademy" platform (www.codecademy.com). The implemented code used in the projects is exclusively from my authorship.

The code implementation is intended to be as a valid additional, non-exhaustive way, to deal with applicable real-life situations.
